### 2021 begins

We rang in 2021 nearly asleep as renegade fireworks erupted in pockets of the city for around 3 minutes. Since then there's been a walk on the beach, the making of [soup](https://girlandthekitchen.com/avgolemono-soup-greek-chicken-soup-lemon/), some laundry, and dealing with adulthood. We woke this morning to some rain outside and the sounds of fast running water inside and a large puddle in the living room seeping from where a pipe had burst. 16 hours later a temporary fix is in place to the plumbing, our floors were mopped up, every towel in existence is being washed/dried, the Christmas tree removed and needles swept, and a drying service has installed several dehumidifiers in our home and in the building. We're now down to a little less space while the water is removed over the next 3-5 days.

A few things that made 2020 ok in no particular order:
-  I've been drinking more ginger turmeric tea throughout the day, usually from Trader Joe's. It's calming with a punch of ginger every few sips.
- I truly enjoyed The Overstory. It was worth the hype and your friends telling you to just read it already.
- I voted in the US 2020 elections and am excited to see the Biden/Harris administration begin on January 20.
- I got a Portal for work and purchased a couple for family members. It's worth all the recommendations. I can have video calls with my parents over dinner and it feels like we're in each other's dining rooms. This means a lot as we haven't seen each other in person in over a year.
- Essential work done to keep us fed, transited, and given medical/dental/vision care.
- Dogs! While we have two (smart, sweet) cats in our home, friends and family members have brought home George, Chase, Hazy Little Thing, and Apple Cider comes home shortly.
- We've  added the Ferry Plaza farmers market to our Saturday routine and appreciate the local produce, the complicated socially-distanced line at Acme Bread, the (essential) people watching, and the hike uphill through Chinatown on the way home.
- The views, views, views from Broadway/Jones, Ina Coolbrith park, Crissy Field, and Lafayette Park. And Ocean Beach. We're still close if no longer next door.
