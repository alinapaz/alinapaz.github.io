I'm often very hungry after morning swims and need to replenish whatever energy I've burned. Enter the breakfast sandwich. It's delicious, it's heavy, it's portable. Burritos count. Here are a few of my favorites in/around San Francisco should you find yourself in a similar situation:

Special breakfast sandwich from [Devil's Teeth](http://www.devilsteethbakingcompany.com/):

- Why it's good: scrambled eggs and cheese, avocado, spicy aioli, flake-y warm biscuit
- Concessions you'll make: waiting more than a few minutes (if it's busy) as each one is made to order

Breakfast combo from [Super Duper](http://superduperburgers.com/):

- Why it's good: no-frills egg/cheese/optional meat sandwich on a toasted English muffin, with coffee and a donut
- Concessions you'll make: this is Super Duper's only breakfast option

Breakfast burrito from [Uno Dos Tacos](http://unodostacos.com/):

- Why it's good: the perfect size not-too-big breakfast burrito with eggs, cheese, potatoes, salsa, optional meat
- Concessions you'll make: longer lines as of late but they move fast
