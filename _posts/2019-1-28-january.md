I was able to take a break after leaving Mapbox and am starting a new role very soon. Here's a look back at how I've spent January 2019:

- Rearranged our storage closet
- Lunched with friends at some of my favorite SF spots. [Nopalito](http://www.nopalitosf.com/), [Underdogs Too](http://www.underdogstoo.com/), [The Grove](https://thegrovesf.com/), [Barcha](http://barcha-sf.com/), [The Snug](http://www.thesnugsf.com/), more
- Wrote a few blogposts
- Watched the fish at [Cal Academy](https://www.calacademy.org/)
- Celebrated my dad's birthday with my parents in Wisconsin
- Swam and rowed in some wild winter water
- Helped hire a new food pantry leader at church
- Made so many dumplings
- Baked [Flour banana bread](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/flours-famous-banana-bread-recipe-2015076), cheesecake, quiche
