In the past two blogposts I'd described a knee injury. I'd neglected to mention in the same accident I also broke my foot. This means one injured knee, one broken foot. On opposite sides. And lots of time at home.

So, 2 months of recuperation has meant 2 months of baking. The latest being
[cookie mix](https://www.bettycrocker.com/products/cookiemix/chocolatechip). It wasn't bad. I probably won't make cookies from a mix again but found the process worth documenting.

Ingredients:

1. Chocolate chip cookie mix

2. 1 stick of butter

3. 1 egg

Steps:

1. Soften butter.

2. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.

3. Dump mix in a large bowl. Add 1 egg + 1 stick of softened butter.

4. Combine mix, egg, butter with a wooden spoon until there's a fairly mealy but consistent substance that sort of resembles cookie dough.

5. Form dough into small balls, about 1/2 inch in diameter. Place on a baking sheet.

6. Bake for 10-15 minutes.

7. Cookies!
